# Real-time face Recognition Using Facenet On Tensorflow 2.X

This is a quick guide of how to get set up and running a robust real-time facial recognition system using the Pretraiend Facenet Model and MTCNN.

1. Make a directory of your name inside the Faces folder and upload your 2-3 pictures of you.
2. Run ``` train_v2.py```.
3. Then run ```detect.py``` for realtime face recognization.

For in depth explanation follow this amazingly expained [article. ðŸ‘ˆ](https://arsfutura.com/magazine/face-recognition-with-facenet-and-mtcnn/)
