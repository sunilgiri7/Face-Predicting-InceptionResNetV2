# Real-time face Recognition Using Facenet On Tensorflow 2.X

This is a quick guide of how to get set up and running a robust real-time facial recognition system using the Pretraiend Facenet Model and MTCNN.

1. Make a directory of your name inside the ``` Faces folder ``` and upload your 2-3 pictures of you.
2. create ``` python3.12 ``` version env and activate
3. install ``` requirements.txt ``` file
4. Run ``` train_v2.py```.
5. Then run ```detect.py``` for realtime face recognization.
